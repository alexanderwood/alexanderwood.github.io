        		<h1>Alexander Wood</h1>
				<p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Biomedical and Clinical Informatics Lab at the University of Michigan in the 
           Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics. My research includes development of image processing and signal 
           processing techniques using medical data, database design and management, and applications of privacy-preserving techniques 
           to medical data.</p>
        <p>I received my PhD in Computer Science at The Graduate Center, CUNY, in 2018, and a Master of Philosophy in Computer Science 
           in this program in 2017. During this time I served as an elected representative for my department as Chairperson of the 
           Computer Science Students' Association, and was the elected student representative on the Executive, Curriculum, and Elections 
           Committees. I also served as the Computer Science Student Representative within the Doctoral Student Council and the Graduate
           Council and co-organized the weekly Graduate Center Crypto-Math Seminar. </p>
        <p>Additionally, I received a Master of Science with Distinction in Pure Mathematics from DePaul University in 2015 after 
           graduating Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Arts in Pure Mathematics from DePaul in 2012. </p>
        <p>I taught a variety mathematics and computer science courses to undergraduates at New York University, New York City College 
           of Technology, John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and DePaul University. Courses taught include Python for Engineering, 
           Cryptography and Cryptanalysis, and Calculus. </p>
